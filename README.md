# Simple Neural Network
This repo contains a simple implementation of a neural network for own learning purposes. This means, that the implementation is not as efficient as other libraries of course, but should implement some important papers in an intuitiv and easy to read way.
All code is written in python

## WIP
- Fully Connected Layers

- Xavier Initialization

- Convolutional Layers

## Future

- RNN / LSTM

- Batch Normalization

- Dropout

- ...
